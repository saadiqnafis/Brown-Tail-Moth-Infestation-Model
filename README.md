# Brown-Tail-Moth-Infestation-Model


Brown Tail Moth, one of Maine's most troublesome species, were accidentally introduced to New England from Europe in 1897. These insects usually affect the trees, but as they are covered with toxic hairs, they can cause skin rash and breathing problems in humans who come in contact with them. 

In the Datathon, I was provided a dataset of almost 15000 entries that included data of number of BTM nests, distance of infested trees from water, infestation condition, latitude and longitude of the infested trees etc. 

I cleaned the data, identified the correct semantic type for each column and generated the summary statistics. After that, I developed a reproducible workflow for map based visualization indicating the infestation of BTM using graphs. I found relations between the BTM infestation and the distance from water of an species. I used the platform Dataiku for drawing such relations. My use of remote sensing and machine learning was well as I could obtain 90% accuracy in predicting which trees of which area are prone to BTM infestation.

The end goal of the project was considering the interests of the stakeholders and coming up with an automated tree treatment strategy that could act as soon as a tree gets affected. The strategy followed a method for classifying a tree whether it should be treated via public works inserts/ contracted manual removal/ contracted injection/ contracted foliar spray.
